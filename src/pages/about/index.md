Orchid started in mid-2009, and we’ve been building and creating things ever since.

We specialise in working with logistics and freight forwarding businesses, but also take on interesting projects with businesses in other industries as well as start-ups.

Our passion is creating simple, elegant web applications, mobile apps and other tools that make your business more efficient, fun and profitable!

### Who's behind Orchid?

We’re based in New Zealand with our headquarters in Albany on Auckland’s North Shore.

As a company, we don’t restrict our recruitment to a small geographic region, which means our team members are the most qualified people, whether you met them out of our office, or they’re working remotely in some of the most unexpected places (including cities like Nelson and Christchurch, and further afield like Brisbane, and even Cebu City).
